Hi. 

I'm Delaney. I work for the [VoteShield](https://voteshield.us/about) project at [Protect Democracy](https://protectdemocracy.org/). 

You can check out my website [here](https://zeldela.github.io/). 

I primarily work in Python, R, and SQL doing data analysis and visualization. I have a background in statistical programming and research from my time at the University of Florida, where I studied statistics and was a member of the [Election Science Group](https://electionscience.clas.ufl.edu/). 

Interested in civic tech or election data? Here are some of my favorite resources: ðŸ“ˆ
